Every month at Everproof, two team members are assigned a coffee catchup.
It was an informal meeting, where we'd head out of the office and spend some times chatting about the weekend, hobbies, etc.
Nathan, the CEO, was in charge of assigning the matchups every month.
</p>
<p>
Born out of our first hackathon, the tech team aimed to build a plugin for Twist (a messaging app, very similar to Slack) which could fully automate coffee catchups.
</p>
<p>
We split the project up, and my role was to build the algorithm which calculated the best matchups.
I used python, and created functions to account for a variety of factors, including previous matchups, and what departments members worked in.
</p>
<p>
I finished the algorithm early, so went on to hook the algorithm directly into Twist through the API. Every month, a trigger within AWS would set the algoritm to work.
