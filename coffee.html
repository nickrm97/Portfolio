<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
Every month at Everproof, two team members are assigned a coffee catchup.
Born out of our first hackathon, the tech team aimed to build a plugin for Twist (a messaging app) which could fully automate these catchups.
My task was to build an algorithm which best determined matchups, and integrate this with Twist's API.
</p>

<h3>Technologies used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://twistapp.com/?lang=en">Twist</a> (messaging app)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> (API Development tool)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithm design:</h3>
<p>
I designed the algorithm in Python. The algorithm would determine the best matchups by scoring all potential matchups,
 (based on a variety of factors), and selecting the most favourable coffee catchups.
</p>
<p>
These factors included:
  <ul>
    <li> The time since their last catchup together</li>
    <li> If they were from the same department (eg. Sales, Support, Engineering)</li>
    <li> The times they had caught up with other members</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  I took great pride in clear and consise code, so that my team members could understand the algorithm in a quick time period.
<h3>Intergration with TwistAPI:</h3>
<p>
As I finished my algorithm earlier than expected, I began intergrating with TwistAPI.
I used Postman to test posting to the API.
</p>

<p>
I linked the notifications to the algorithm through a post_notifications() function -
every month when the algorithm ran, the notifications were instantaneously posted to Twist.
