<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
I currently tutor VCE mathematics, and wanted to create an app which allowed my students to track their study. I used the Django web development framework to create this.
This was my first complete project with Django, and I was learning by doing - I taught myself how to interact with data models, work with an MVC architecture and design a solid user experience.
</p>

<h3>Technologies used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> (a web framework built on Python)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a> (grid system and styling)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">Github</a> (version control)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> (host and run Python)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.chartjs.org/">ChartJS</a> (simple javascript graphs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deploying and hosting online</h3>
<p>
  So that my students could use the site, I purchased the domain coolstudyfriend.com. I bought some basic web hosting to host a static marketing site.
  I installed the Django app on the subdomain app.coolstudyfriend.com, hosted and deployed through PythonAnywhere.
</p>

<h3>Product management (interaction with users):</h3>
<p>
  CoolStudyFriend was my first project with live users. This exposed me to requested features, fixing bugs and prioritising tasks.
  I created a <a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/b/XDP4qAkE/coolstudyfriend">Trello board</a> which allowed me to track and organise the tasks at hand.
</p>

<h3>Creating an API</h3>
<p>
  To challenge myself with this project, I built a small API which allowed for easy interactions with my student's data.
  I used this API to implement ChartJS - through this plugin, I could easily create graphs which showed the hours students had dedicated to study throughout the week.
