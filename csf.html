To compliment tutoring, I used Django to create a study app to allow my students to log their study and homework hours.
This was my first real project with Django, and I was definitely learning by doing - I began to understand how to interact with data models, work with an MVC framework and create a solid user experience.

I also learnt how to create, edit and delete data models. The video below shows the basic flow for a student adding a study session.
