<h3> Description </h3>
<p>
Working against a set of designs given to me by a contracted UI designer, I was tasked with building the company's marketing website from scratch.
I used <a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a> for it's grid system and responsive design.
</p>
<p>
 To create modules (such as the navbar) that I could write once and import multiple times, I used <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/"> Jekyll.</a>
Through Jekyll, sales staff could create lander pages for potential clients in markdown. I created a variety of layouts to suit different organisations.
</p>
<p>
I also used <a target="_blank" href="https://buddy.works/">Buddy</a>, a system which could build Jekyll sites from Github and deploy it automatically through FTP.
This meant changes to the website's master branch could go live instantly.
