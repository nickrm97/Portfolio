<h3> Description </h3>
<p>
Working against a set of designs given to me by a contracted UI designer, I was tasked with building multiple iterations of <a target="_blank" href="https://everproof.com/">Everproof's</a> marketing website.
I was responsible for all decisions regarding this project, including the technology implemented.
</p>
<h3> Technologies used: </h3>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a> (grid system and styling)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://buddy.works/">Buddy</a> (continuous deployment)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll</a> (static site generation)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">Github</a> (version control)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://crossbrowsertesting.com/">Cross Browser Testing</a> (optimisation across all devices)</li>
</ul>
<h3> Continuous deployment (Buddy): </h3>
<p>
  A key requirement of the project was the ability to update website content instantaneously.
  I researched tools to assist, and implemented Buddy. Buddy offered continuous deployment, so that changes to the master branch (on Github) were instantly deployed on the Everproof website.
</p>
<h3> Static site generation (Jekyll): </h3>
<p>
  When building the website, I had two important criteria: (a) sales staff could create pages with ease (b) redundant code could be avoided through the use of reusable modules (eg. Navbar)
  I needed to utilise a static site generator.
</p>
<p>
  Through the use of docs and tutorials, I taught myself how to implement Jekyll.
   I built templates for various pages - these templates assisted sales staff in creating new content without needing to code.
</p>
<h3> Cross browser/device testing: </h3>
<p>
  To ensure the website was to specification across all devices, I used Cross Browser Testing. This service enabled me to fix browser-specific bugs that occured (mostly with Internet Explorer!).
</p>
<h3> Search Engine Optimisation (SEO): </h3>
<p>
  I researched the best techniques for search engine optimisation, and correctly formatted the META tags and website content.
  I also harnessed the power of <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google Insights</a> to best optimise the website.
