title: Flamingo - Everproof's Admin App
tags: ['HTML/CSS', 'PYTHON']
---
<p>
As a software engineer intern at Everproof, one of my tasks was to build an admin app for the new version of the platform.
I created Flamingo as a seperate app within the new platform. Through this, I could intergrate directly with the data models and database.
</p>
<p>
The app was created entirely in Django, using Bootstrap for easy responsive design.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I can't currently share the code, but I have created a video showing the app in use.
