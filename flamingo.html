<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
As a software engineer intern at Everproof, one of my tasks was to build a customer relationship management app for the new version of the Everproof platform.
I created Flamingo as a seperate app within the pre-existing Django app. Through this, I could intergrate directly with the data models using an MVC architecture.
</p>

<h3> Technologies used: </h3>
<ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> (a web framework built on Python)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a> (grid system and styling)</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">Github</a> (version control)</li>
</ul>

<h3>MVC architecture, data models and ORM:</h3>
<p>
  One of the greatest strengths of this project was the clean intergration with the data models. I made use of Django's predefined class-based views,
  simplifying the development process for reoccuring features (adding, editing, deleting objects). For more complicated interactions with the data models, I wrote method-based views.
</p>

<h3>Working simultaneously with another developer:</h3>
<p>
  I learnt about the importance of branches within version control when collaborating in a team. I found that communication and clear objectives allowed for an efficient development process.
</p>

<h3>UI/UX design & product management:</h3>
<p>
  I worked closely with the customer success staff - I met with the team regularly, so that I could understand the common flows (eg. adding a user to an organisation).
  I designed the CRM system so that these operations could be performed in a logical manner.

<h3>Proudest feature:</h3>
<p>
  One of my greatest challenges with this project was to cleanly implement the documents page.
  In this page, all documents associated with a user were to be listed in categories, according to the organisations these documents were viewable by.
  I had tried a solution using Javascript, but it got fairly messy.
</p>
<p>
  Eventually, I completed the page using just Django and HTML. The code was much cleaner and self-contained.
  The documents page is viewable in the video below. It was a rewarding feeling to overcome this challenge.
