    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p>Hello, my name's Nick! I'm currently studying accounting and computer science at the University of Melbourne. I have a passion for software engineering.<p>
    <p>I'm hungry to pursue computing through every avenue possible. This includes online tutorials, personal projects, on-the-job training and formal education.</p>
    <p>My ideal work environment maximises collaboration and learning. I love diving into tougher projects in a team environment.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball, film photography and travelling. I also teach basic web dev to high school students.</p>

              <p class="card-text">
                Working off a set of designs, I was tasked with building a new static site for Everproof.
                I used a variety of tools to create the website, including Bootstrap, Jekyll and Buddy.
                I met reguarly with the business directors to ensure the project met specification.

              <p class="card-text">Using the Django web framework, I built an admin app which directly intergrated with the data models for Everproof's app.
                I worked closely with the support team to best create an app which would assist with their work.</p>

                <p class="card-text">
                  Born during an Everproof hackathon, I worked in a team to develop a coffee bot.
                  The CoffeeCat aimed to automate assignment of monthly coffee catchups between team members.
                  I developed an algorithm in python which considered a variety of factors before matching team members.

              <p class="card-text">To encourage my tutoring students to track their study, I developed this webapp through Django.
              As this was my first webapp with active users, I learnt how to respond to "customer" demands and suggestions. I also enjoyed carefully designing various UX flows.</p>
